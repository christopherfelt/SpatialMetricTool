# SpatialMetricTool
Tool Created and Used for Researching Urban Fragmentation

Description: This script is for a custom script in ArcGIS. The script will take in a shapefile and raster. Then, using the polygons in the shapefile, the tool will clip the raster. The resulting raster clips will then be processed through the fragmentation metric software Fragstats.
